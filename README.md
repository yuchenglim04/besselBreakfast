This is an unofficial, and self-proclaimed an NTU Math and Physics club (cult?). But since Physics and Math together constitute the theory of everything, anything technical, elegant, ingenius and crazy fits here too.

Goals of this club/some personal opinions:  
- encourage students to take on the challenge to self-learn
- provide guidance on where to start, and ideas on how crazy things can be
- tips and tricks :)
- an alternative NTU curriculum: eccentric, unorthodox
- contribute to open-source movement: the purpose of open-source software isn't free software, but freely accessible knowledge, how algorithms are developed and implemented etc

We currently have no plans on creating a webpage. Instead, all articles will be posted here. Do familiarise yourself with navigating the repository. 

Anyone has a better name for the club? Your suggestions are highly appreciated.
