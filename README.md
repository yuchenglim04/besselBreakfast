# Bessel for Breakfast $\int^{\infty}_{0} J_0 (x) dx = 1$

What's the best way to learn Bessel functions?

*A cheatsheet on the wall, with breakfast at hand*

Physics, mathematics, electronics, programming? I've always wondered how to construct a radio; how was QFT discovered, how did it evolve to its present state; how to build an oscilloscope; how to design IC's, or even a CPU; how best to understand open cover and compact sets; how to build a drone???

### What this repository is not:  
A textbook, an encyclopedia, a comprehensive knowledgebase containing everything

### What this repository is:
Projects we've done, some problems and solutions, what's possible, what's not. Most importantly, our goal is to answer those crazy questions presented above, and more. We will present our answers and how we got there, not as a foolproof way for you to learn, but just to show what's possible, plus some tips and tricks. Also, to show that science is beautiful. As beautiful as a random mathematical curiosity with no apparent application. Also, we're still learning. For now this repo will seem fairly sparse...

### How best to learn a subject?  
From personal experience, make good notes. Use colored pens, not just pencil (dull monotone writing ruins mood....). Use erasable pens (ðŸ©·Pilot Frixion), but with discipline. Don't try to copy the textbook. Rephrase whole textbook in terms of problems and solutions. Copy out good problems and solutions. Avoid cookie-cutter problems (or at least they are not meant for notes). Notes are **not** meant to record down very general formulas and derivations that you have no idea how to apply. Record down how to tailor general formulas to specific geometries, tips and tricks etc. Organize by topic, by system. Collect different ways of solving the same problem, from different books or the Internet, keeping them all in the same file. Also, different questions you can ask about a particular system; each question often takes a whole page!

Collect these notes; grow them as you learn more and more. Grow! Don't throw them away!

### Example:
When doing electromagnetism, you can organize problems by systems. All problems related to the electric dipole. All problems related to Laplacian and spherical surface, conducting or not. These problems might come from different books of different level ("high school" to graduate or even papers).
