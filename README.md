# Bessel for Breakfast $\int^{\infty}_{0} J_0 (x) dx = 1$

What happens when:

a Mathematician  
a Physicist  
a Computer Freak  
an Electronics Guru  
a Hardware Specialist

are placed together in the same lab? Perhaps space travel could be a reality. But first, we need a well-curated knowledgebase, to learn things in the shortest time possible.

What's the best way to learn Bessel functions then?
