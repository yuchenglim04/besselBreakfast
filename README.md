# Bocchi the Hacker has Bessel for Breakfast

Musings of a fiziks freak.

This is an unofficial, and self-proclaimed an NTU Math and Physics club (cult?). But since Physics and Math together constitute the theory of everything, anything technical, elegant, ingenius and crazy fits here too.

### Goals of this club/some personal opinions:  
- encourage students to take on the challenge to self-learn
- provide guidance on where to start, and ideas on how crazy things can be
- tips and tricks :)
- an alternative NTU curriculum: eccentric, unorthodox
- contribute to open-source movement: the purpose of open-source software isn't free software, but freely accessible knowledge, how algorithms are developed and implemented etc

We currently have no plans on creating a webpage. Instead, all articles will be posted here. Do familiarise yourself with navigating the repository. 

Anyone has a better name for the club? Your suggestion is highly appreciated. I just hope that the eccentric name of this repo isn't an infringment on trademark/IP... As for why Bocchi, I thought that it aligns with in the spirit of science: science is meant to be fun.
