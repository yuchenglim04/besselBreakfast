**Check WSL version via Windows command prompt**
`wsl -l -v`

**Programmes downloaded in Windows vs in WSL**  
`jupyter      # WSL`  
`jupyter.exe  # Windows`  
Try `which` to find out  

**File system**  
`/mnt/c/Users/user_name/      # Windows`  
`~/                           # WSL`

**To open a WSL folder in Windows file explorer**  
`explorer.exe ..`

**To automatically start WSL from home!**  
`Ctrl + ,      # short cut for settings`  
`              # choose startup > default profile > Tux mascot ubuntu`   
This gave me the idea, but I did not follow it all the way! I opended the settings and hit gold!
