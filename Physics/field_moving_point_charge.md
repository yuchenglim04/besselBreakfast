Many ways of deriving the field of a moving point charge:

Griffiths:  
Lienard-Wiechert potential from intuition
Fields by direct differentiaion of Lienard-Wiechert potential

Jerry Marion:
Lienard-Wiechert potential from time delta function
Fields from Jefimenko's equation and time delta function

Fields by direct differentiaion of Lienard-Wiechert potential in integral form (delta function integrand)

Lienard-Wiechert potential via direct evaluation of retarded integral with spatial delta function integrand, and change of variables
