Jackson:  



Lienard-Wiechert potential via direct evaluation of retarded integral with spatial delta function integrand, and change of variables using Jacobian

Lienard-Wiechert potential via special relativity


With blood, sweat and tears (and some heroic algebra), it will all magically work out :)
