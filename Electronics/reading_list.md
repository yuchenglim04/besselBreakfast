Learning electronics is all about **comparing** oscilloscope traces and circuit diagrams. Intuition!

It's useful to think in terms of "problem" and "solution", and to summarize papers as a bbbbiiiigggg list of problems.

Below is a list of application notes some of us have read or plan to read. Happy reading!
