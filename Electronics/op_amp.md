The best way to learn op amps is to start from simple ideal models and slowly add more and more complications.

Non-inverting amplifier:
- Resistor sizing:
  - resistors cannot be too small -> large current exceeding max current output of Op Amp
  - resistors cannot be too large -> greater noise 

Inverting amplifier:
- ideal model
