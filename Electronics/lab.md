When analyzing results, it is important to keep in mind the following:

oscilloscope's model:
- oscilloscope bandwidth
- sampling rate

oscilloscope's setup:
- probe attenuation: x10 or x1
- voltage and time step

Surrounding electronics or electrical appliances hence sources of noise!

Frequency generator's model:
- internal impedance
- bandwidth

And compare with what you are trying to measure:
- frequencies beyond bandwidth are severely attenuated
- x10 will make measured data more noisy than it really is
- x1 might load the circuit
